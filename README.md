QueApp by Ricky Spires May 2017.


Scenario

We have a council 
who would like to use an application to queue people at the reception 
desk. The receptionist should be able to select the service and 
take the customer details depending on the customer type:

• Citizen: title, first name and last name fields should be displayed
• Organisation: organisation name field should be visible
• Anonymous: no input fields should be visible

Customer would also like to see the currently queued people in a list.


The Build

This has been built using standard HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap3, Bootstrap Validator, Javascript, Json and JQuery.

I have also added a button to each row to say if they have been seen or no and a clear all button. There is also a popup to warn people that if they leave the page their data will be lost as I have not added local storage or a database.
